<h1>ðŸ”‘ Tried Passwords CLI</h1>

I forgot my password, so I am using this to brute force lmao. Please help.

### How it works?

You know how you forgot your password so you try to brute force your way through every password combination in your memory. Sometimes you write the same password over and over because you're dum.

**ðŸ«µ WELL, NOT ANYMORE!**

Just run this program, it will keep track of the new passwords you write here so you know which passwords are a "new combination" from your session. They will be saved in `tried-passwords.txt`.

Hope you get your password back! ðŸ¥¹

### Get Started

```sh
# Install deps
go mod tidy

# Run the program.
go run .
```
